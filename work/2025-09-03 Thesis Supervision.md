# 1 OT
Annealing of $V_B^-$ samples with graphite: the exact sample from the paper! -> Talk with Corné

Check:
- atmosphere
- vacuum
- **temperature**

<ins>Ask Corné also for measuring</ins>.

- Measure the spectrum **again** before annealing.

Careful with the glass boat -> cleanliness

# 2 Thesis
1.1 Luminescent centers in general
1.5 ~~Quantum~~ Applications
1.6 Goal **and motivation**

2.1 Optical transitions -> generalise to **of dipole emitters**
	Start 2 level model -> go to *n* level model
	Add Spin degree of freedom -> spin sublevels
2.2 What is a good detection method to detect SPSs
2.3 Add ODMR

3.1 Separate Results chapter in "Paper 1" and "Additional results"

4.1 Other results: device

Conclusion and outlook:

maybe mention also applications

# 3 OT (Device)

Use current mode to avoid current spikes in the IV curve!

> [!NOTE] Remember
> Ask Ilia for post processing of IV-PL results to see PL quench!!!

# 4 Sensors

1. Vincent Jacques
2. ~~Hannah Stern~~
3. Dyakonov (?)
4. Asgar (?)
5. Battulga (DTU)

# 5 To Do

Send email for meeting (Ilia and Corné)
