# Brief introduction
## Description
_Describe your business in 150 words or less. The introduction should be a very short
and precise description of the concept, solution, strategy and implementation._

DoubleQuantum addresses the urgent need for scalable single-photon sources (SPSs), essential for quantum communication, sensing, and photonic computing. Current quantum-dot SPSs deliver high efficiency but require cryogenic cooling, limiting deployment in real-world and space environments while increasing cost and environmental impact.
We aim to enter this rapidly growing market with a novel, fully integrated solution: turn-key, room-temperature on-chip SPS modules based on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). By targeting the yet unexplored segment of scalable, ambient-operational SPSs, we combine cavity-enhanced efficiency with the robustness of 2D materials, creating plug-and-play quantum light sources ideally suited for terrestrial and satellite networks.
Our strategy begins with soft funding and partnerships with academia and governmental agencies (B2G) to validate the technology and stimulate market pull. Building on this foundation, we will then attract venture capital to scale production and commercialization, positioning DoubleQuantum as a key player in the next generation of quantum photonics.
## Stage
*What stage is your startup in? Please see the FAQ section on our website, “Startup*
*Stage Template”.*

DoubleQuantum is currently at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4. The core principles of our technology—hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) single-photon emitters coupled to nanocavities—are well-established and validated in laboratory settings, with a strong body of peer-reviewed publications supporting their performance. We have a proof-of-concept device that demonstrates feasibility but further work is required to validate full system performance in relevant environments.
On the production side, we are at Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 3. A proof-of-concept can be demonstrated to investors, but repeatable low-volume manufacturing processes and production tooling still need to be developed for scalability.
Regarding intellectual property and freedom-to-operate (FtO), our preliminary patent landscape analysis shows multiple active filings around hBN-based emitters, emitter fabrication methods, and integrated photonic devices. While this confirms strong market interest, it also indicates the need for a focused FtO strategy. To this end, we will leverage our exclusive partnership with DTU Electro, making use of their in-house nanocavity design and fabrication expertise for strong dielectric confinement and emission enhancement. This positions us to file patents on our own proprietary technology as the platform matures, supported by dedicated legal expertise to ensure protection and freedom to operate.
# Product and / or service description
## Customer Pain
*Describe what problem/need your customer is facing, and why the customers would pay for*
*a solution.*
Customers in quantum communications, sensing, and photonic quantum computing urgently require **reliable, efficient single-photon sources (SPSs)**. Today, the state-of-the-art relies on **quantum-dot based SPSs**, which deliver bright and indistinguishable photons but require **cryogenic cooling**. This creates several pain points:
- **High deployment cost and complexity**: cryogenic infrastructure adds bulk, energy consumption, and maintenance requirements, making systems difficult to scale or integrate outside the laboratory.    
- **Limited scalability and mobility**: field deployments—especially in **space and satellite-based quantum communication**—are severely constrained by cryogenic needs, and high-energy consumption can constitute a severe limiting factor especially in such extreme conditions like space operations.    
- **Environmental footprint**: energy-intensive cooling leads to higher operational costs and sustainability concerns.

## Business Idea
*Describe your idea and how it solves the problem the customer is facing as mentioned*
*above.*
**DoubleQuantum** will deliver the **first scalable, room-temperature, on-chip single-photon sources (SPSs)** based on **hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) quantum emitters integrated into nanophotonic cavities**. Unlike existing quantum-dot sources that require cryogenic cooling, our solution operates under ambient conditions, drastically reducing complexity, energy consumption, and deployment barriers.

By leveraging our **exclusive partnership with DTU Electro**, we will access state-of-the-art nanocavity design and fabrication expertise to achieve strong dielectric confinement and emission enhancement. This enables the creation of **turn-key, plug-and-play SPS modules** that can be seamlessly coupled into fibers and photonic circuits.

Our technology directly solves the key customer pain points: it eliminates costly cryogenic infrastructure, enables **scalable and mobile deployment** (including space-based quantum communication), and reduces the **carbon footprint** of quantum technologies. This positions DoubleQuantum to capture a rapidly growing market by opening the **yet-unexplored segment of ambient-operational SPSs**, offering unmatched operational versatility for both industry and government applications.
